## A Cafe Application

I am creating an application that keeps track of cafes that someone has been to. When adding a cafe, the individual
would have to answer:
- Good Study Spot?
- Good Coffee?
- Good Food?
Each cafe will also have a name, an address, a rating out of 10.

I think that new incoming students who are new to a country would make use of this application. As an international
student myself, I love exploring the new areas especially to look for a quiet place where I can grab a coffee, study 
or just wind down with some good food. I believe that other students would feel the same way and this application 
would be there so that people can remember the cafes that were their favourite and least favourite. 


## User Stories
In the context of a cafe application:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a cafe to my list of cafes.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the cafes in my list
- As a user, I want to be able to view the cafes on if they have a good study spot, good coffee or good food
- As a user, I want to select the cafe to find the address
- As a user, I want to see the ranking of the cafes based off the ratings
- As a user, I want to save my cafe list automatically when the application closes
- As a user, I want to load my cafe list automatically when the application opens

## Phase 4: Task 2
Tue Mar 29 14:06:29 PDT 2022
This cafe has been added to the CafeList

Tue Mar 29 14:06:29 PDT 2022
Cafe is saved onto system.


This pattern of logs is added about 4 times and this is because I have saved it in three different places because it is 
being saved onto 3 different category lists plus the main cafe list.

## Phase 4: Task 3

If I had more time to work on the project:
- I would make the ui classes involve higher cohesion for initializing the frames and panels
- I think that I did repeat a lot of the code for some classes, and this could have been declared in a
singular class and then called on, to make the code look less messy.
- Should add specific exceptions that are thrown as I did not make any
- Instead of saving several lists, filter out the main saved list into the categories to reduce using code that would 
be unnecessary if a filter function existed.
